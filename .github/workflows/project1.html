  <h2>Search Engines</h2>
  <p>Search engines function as a built-in feature of numerous online browsers that allow users to easily find what they want at a given movement. While some may be different from others in terms of how they look or what specific features are associated with them, they all universally share the same purpose.</p>

    <h2>Meta Tags</h2>
    <p>Keywords and descriptions are important in the sense that if a user does not have the time to patience to read through an entire article, a simple blurb or a set of descriptors at the bottom will tell them everything that they need to know without being too needlessly long.</p>

    <h2>Content Links</h2>
    <p>Content links must be relevant to the subject at hand, made to be functional, visible enough to be seen but not enough to distract from other elements of a website, and have titles that indicate what they purpose they serve.</p>

    <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>Heading hierarchy requires a thorough understanding of form and the nuances associated with it in order to look as professional as it can be. One prominent example of this can be found within the website for the University of Maryland Global Campus, which utilizes numerous heading tags, each one designed to flow down from the other, to provide a sleek and understandable interface.</p>
